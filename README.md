# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV
Using OpenCV's inbuilt model for Face Detection.

### Description
OpenCV provides a very accurate inbuilt face detection model. In this project, I've used that model and created my own face detection project.

### Steps to run (Pipenv Virtual Environment)
1. Clone the project to your local system
2. Navigate inside the project directory on your local system inside the terminal
3. Install all dependencies using `pipenv install --ignore-pipfile`
4. Enter the environment using `pipenv shell`
5. Start the application using `python face_detector.py`
6. To quit, just press the keyboard key `q`.

### Steps to run (pip3)
1. Clone the project to your local system
2. Navigate inside the project directory on your local system inside the terminal
3. Install all dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start the application using `python3 face_detector.py`
5. To quit, just press the keyboard key `q`.
